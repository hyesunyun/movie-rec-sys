# movie-rec-sys

Extra Lecture for CS6983/CS4973 Research in Human-Centered NLP (Northeastern University).

You can run these notebooks on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hyesunyun/). 
You won't need to create a virtual environment for Google Colab as it comes with all the packages we need installed. However, you will need to manually add the data (`Top_10000_Movies.csv` from data folder) to the files in Google Colab.
